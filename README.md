# algorithms-and-data-structures

My collection of data structures and algorithms implementations, which I've coded from scratch/memory based on Kevin Wayne and Bob Sedgewick's *Algorithms, 4th Edition*. Thus far, I have:

* Disjoint-Sets (Forest of Trees Implementation w/ Path Compression) 
* Bag (LinkedList Implementation)
* Stack (LinkedList and ResizingArray Implementations)
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
